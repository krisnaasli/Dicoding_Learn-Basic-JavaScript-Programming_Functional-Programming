#### * Coding Quiz: Functional Programming (main.js)
This program consists of an array of books containing a list of books along with their authors and sales amount, and the creation of a greatAuthors variable based on the filter() and map() results of the books array.
The purpose of this program is to create a greatAuthors variable that contains a list of book authors who have a sales amount of more than 1,000,000. Then, each author and book title that meets the criteria is formatted into a string.
So, this program is a JavaScript script that manipulates the books array by using the filter() and map() functions to create a list of book authors who have high sales, then formatting the results into a string.
